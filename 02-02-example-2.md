EXAMPLE 2: GIT FOR AGES 4 AND UP
In his talk "Git for Ages 4 And Up" (OSDC, 2010), Michael Schwern uses Tinker Toys to teach the audience how Git works.

Check out the very first sentence in the session description (_emphasis added_):

>**Git makes so much more sense when you understand how it really works**, because it's really a two trick pony.
> Tinker Toys are the best illustration of a Git repository I've found. Side-by-side with issuing Git commands, we'll build a Git repository out of kid's toys showing what's going on behind the scenes. Mind bending concepts like remote branching, rebase and the staging area become child's play.
