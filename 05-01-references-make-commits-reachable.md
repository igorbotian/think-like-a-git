## References Make Commits Reachable ##

Let's unpack that sentence.

**References...**

...whether they are local branches, remote branches, or tags (see [here](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git/the-reference-reference.html))...

**...Make commits...**

...which are nodes in a graph (see [here](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git.html))...

**...reachable.**

...so that you can get back to them (see [here](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graph-theory/reachability.html)), and so that Git won't delete them when it decides it's time for spring cleaning (see [here](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git/garbage-collection.html)).

It took me a really long time to piece this together for myself. I'm writing this site so that you don't have to waste the time I did.
