# Git Makes More Sense When You Understand X #

As I mentioned in [Why This Site?](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/about-this-site/why-this-site.html), I once tried to help a friend learn Git by saying something that—he later told me—wasn't all that helpful. After getting that feedback, I started noticing this pattern:

I've chosen a few examples of this pattern to talk about briefly.
