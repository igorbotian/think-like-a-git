**Git shouldn't so hard to learn**

When you're just getting started, something as straightforward as a merge can be terrifying. It can take a long time to really become comfortable using some of Git's more advanced features. (It took me a year or two.)

Once people achieve some level of **Git enlightenment**, they tend to make statements of the form 'Git gets a lot easier once you realize X' - but that doesn't do much for people staring up Git's steep learning curve.

My goal with this site is to help you, Dear Reader, **understand what those smug bastards are talking about**.
