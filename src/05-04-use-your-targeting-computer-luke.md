## Use Your Targeting Computer, Luke ##

I use GitX in almost every coding session. GitX behaves like a web browser in one very important way: **it won't immediately reflect changes to your repository** â€” you have to hit **Cmd+R** to tell it to (**R**)efresh its view. _(Since I first wrote this, later forks of GitX have added auto-refresh. I always turn it off.)_

You can use this to your advantage. Here's how: **when you've done something on the command line**, switch back to your visualizer, but **don't refresh right away**. Instead, try to predict how what you did will change its view. _(You can even try drawing out the graph on an index card.)_ Then, refresh the visualizer and ask yourself: **did it change in the way you expected**?

**If the answer is YES**: Congratulations! You just learned something!

**If the answer is NO**: Congratulations! You're about to learn something!

Repeat this process several thousand times, and eventually you won't need to refer to the visualizer as often. _(For those of you who like bad sci-fi movies, think of it as less "Use the force, Luke" and more_ ***"Usul no longer needs the weirding module.")***
