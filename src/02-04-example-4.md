## Example 4: LSD and Chainsaws ##

This one isn't strictly of the same pattern, but I think it still captures the overall theme that Git is powerful and strange, and must be meditated upon to achieve enlightenment:

`git commit --amend` hopped up on acid and holding a chainsaw–completely insane and quite dangerous but capable of exposing entirely new states of mind."
