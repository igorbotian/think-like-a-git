## Attaching Labels to Edges ##

Just as we can label the nodes in a graph, we can also attach information to the edges. This might include:

- *Names* — for example, "12th Avenue".
- *Numbers (also called "weights")* — like distances or speeds.
- *Types* — to denote relationships, like "friend" or "coworker" or "parent of".
- *Direction* — in the previous example, relationships like "friend" and "coworker" are bidirectional, but "parent of" only goes one way _(unless, possibly, you're a character in a Robert A. Heinlein novel)_.

In fact, that last point about directionality is so important that it deserves its own page.
