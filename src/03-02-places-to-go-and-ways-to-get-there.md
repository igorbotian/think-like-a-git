## Places To Go, and Ways to Get There ##

Here are two versions of the KÃ¶nigsberg map. On the left is a smaller version of the map you've already seen, and on the right is the version Euler used in his 1735 proof.

Here's what I think is so mind-bendingly cool about this: **Euler threw away all the information that didn't matter to the problem**.

If all you're concerned with is which bridges you cross, then for all intents and purposes, **each land mass can be represented by a point**, and **each bridge is just a line between two points**.

Which is why I say you can think of graph theory as the study of **places to go, and ways to get there**.
