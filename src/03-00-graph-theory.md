# Graph Theory #

**If you're already comfortable with graph theory, skip ahead to [Reachability](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graph-theory/reachability.html).]**

For a rather math-intensive introduction to graph theory, [see Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Here's a very short version of the definition they use there:

> A graph refers to a collection of nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes.

Graph theory can be used to describe a lot of things, but I'll start off with one of the most straightforward examples: maps. You can think of graph theory as a way of encoding information about two aspects of a map: **places to go, and ways to get there**.

Let's start at the very beginning, shall we?

_[By the way: as important human inventions go, I happen to think graph theory is right up there alongside bacon and indoor plumbing. It takes some time to really sink in, though, so ***if you find your eyes glazing over in this section, don't worry about it.*** As long as the page about [reachability](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graph-theory/reachability.html) makes sense to you, you can come back and reread these pages later.]_
