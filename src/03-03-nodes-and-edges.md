## Nodes and Edges ##

In the previous page, I said graph theory boils down to **places to go, and ways to get there**. Let's have another look at the definition I used earlier.

A graph refers to a collection of **nodes** and a collection of **edges** that connect pairs of nodes.

**Nodes**: Places to be
**Edges**: Ways to get there

In the KÃ¶nigsberg example, the land masses and islands are nodes, and the bridges are edges.
