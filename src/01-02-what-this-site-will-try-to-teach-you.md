## What This Site Will Try to Teach You ##

My goal is to give you **a simple strategy for safely experimenting** with some of the features that make Git so insanely, awesomely useful.

In order to do that, I need to make sure you know at least a little tiny bit about graph theory. ***Don't be intimidated by this!*** I hope you'll find, as I did, that graph theory just gives you a convenient place to hang a lot of concepts you're already familiar with.

Once I've introduced graph theory, I'll show you how it applies to Git, and I'll share my "Git epiphany" with you.

Finally, I'll explain the pattern I use to this day in working with Git repositories.
