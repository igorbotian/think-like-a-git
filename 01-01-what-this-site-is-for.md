## Who This Site Is For ##

"Advanced beginners" with Git. You should know how to create a repository, add and commit files to it, and you should probably have some idea of why you might want to use a branch.

If you're still struggling with what version control software is for, this site may not be that useful to you. **I encourage you to poke around**, but if you're not getting much out of it, check out my [resources page](http://think-like-a-git.net/resources.html) for some pointers, and consider coming back to this site later.

On the other hand, if you can already do a `git rebase --interactive` without breaking a sweat, you may not get that much out of the site. (But I hope it gives you a framework for helping others learn!) I encourage you to look over the [Resources](http://think-like-a-git.net/resources.html), and suggest any other links you've found that have helped you get to where you are now.
